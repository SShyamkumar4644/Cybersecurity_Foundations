We're all familiar with the basics of protecting ourselves against viruses and other forms of malware. However, this is just one part of the landscape of 
cybersecurity standards and frameworks, which together provide a structured approach to managing cyber risk. Understanding these frameworks provides a good 
foundation for anyone with an interest in, or wishing to build a career in, cybersecurity. You don't need to be a cybersecurity professional to take this LinkedIn 
learning course, but it would help to be familiar with the concept of technology risk and control. ISACA's Control Objectives for IT provide the best-practice model 
of IT processes and will help provide the context for the threats to, and protection of, IT systems. NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides the most recognized approach 
to cybersecurity in an internet-enabled world. And some pre-reading would be helpful in taking this course.
